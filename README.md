<p>I am a motivated and ambitious Full Stack Developer who enjoys solving complex problems and helping my team succeed. I recently graduated from Makers Academy and am passionate about writing fully tested clean code. I have excellent communication skills which I refined during my career in the fitness industry and I am always breaking down problems into small achievable actions, a trait I developed whilst completing my Masters degree in Civil Engineering. I continue to immerse myself in the world of software development and I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to learn, whilst solving real-world problems with a team of ambitious people.</p>

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

The blending of maths and physics to solve practical real world problems was what convinced me that engineering was for me. For 4 years I was instructed on how to break down problems into small achievable actions, how to find multiple solutions and then select the most appropriate. The benefits of having a holistic approach to problem solving, to working to end-user requirements and the importance of taking account of all stakeholders wants and needs was impressed upon me during my degree. I am able to utilise this knowledge when employing an Agile development process, which has been described as 'Strong' in my last review. I also have a 3 Star Silver Badge for Problem Solving on Hackerrank.

#### Communication

I refined my communication skills when leading a diverse team as Manager of a well established mixed martial arts gym in London. I regularly would teach martial arts to beginners and prided myself on being able to breakdown complex techniques to those new to them. During my latest review my ability to justify the way I worked was described as being 'Strong' and this would allow me to immediately contribute to the success of a team and accelerate my development around experienced teammates.

#### Fast Learner
At Makers we were continually pushed to grow and develop our skills on a daily basis. After spending most of the course learning Ruby, I was quickly able to pick up Javascript and start implementing it to build simple web apps. For our final group project, we took this a step further and built our project using React. Having not being taught any of these technologies during the course, it was a testament to how fast I can adapt and learn new technologies in a collaborative environment.
