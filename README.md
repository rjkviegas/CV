# Motivation

Every since I followed the recommendation of a friend to try coding out I became hooked. I started with Khan Academy, Codecademy and attending training workshops. That 6 month period of self learning confirmed to me that coding was what I wanted to do. I felt I was ready for the next step. After surveying the range of bootcamps on offer I decided upon [Makers](https://makers.tech/). Since enrolling my passion for coding has only grown. I have never found something to be so rewarding as writing a test, watching it fail and then making it pass. The philosophy behind TDD, as articulated by proponents like Uncle Bob, resonates with me deeply.

# Background

I'm a problem solver - whether the problem consisted of figuring out the required tensile strength of a steel-reinforced concrete beam, to manipulating my opponent's body during a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu match - I've always relished the opportunity to solve it. I meet all challenges infront of me with 100% effort. Since completion of my Master's degree in Civil Engineering at Loughborough University I dedicated the last 7 years of my life to the martial art/sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I am very proud to have a European Silver medal to show for my efforts. Prior to Makers I worked as the Gym Manager at one of the biggest mixed martial arts gyms in Europe. The fast-paced every-changing nature of work within the fitness industry is one I excelled within, however the mental stimulation, the challenge and subsequent reward embedded within coding has since engulfed my existence. 

# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [Only Fours and Horses Acebook (Facebook)](https://github.com/harrylb14/acebook-onlyfoursandhorses) [Heroku deployment](http://intense-scrubland-58731.herokuapp.com)| A team of 4 came together to recreate our own version of Facebook.| 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku | RSpec, Capybara, Travis CI & CD |

# Skills

I've trained at Makers following **TDD** methodology, in addition to **AGILE** and **XP values**. My experience of training as a full time athlete meant I was well suited to the intensity and discipline required to excel on the 12 week course. REVIEWER: I have shown rigourous application of the TDD design cycle (Red-Green-Refactor) whilst also taking time to ensure my code is as clean as possible.

## Problem Solving

The blending of maths and physics to solve practical real world problems was what initially convinced me that engineering was for me. For 4 years I was instructed on how to approach problems, how to find multiple solutions and select the most appropriate. It was impressed upon me to benefits of having a holistic perspective to problem solving, to working to end-user requirements and the importance of taking account of all stakeholders wants and needs. The daily managing of a gym that had up to 1500 members has allowed me to seek out new and inventful solutions to constantly improve the gym's performance. My proudest achievement was creating and implementing a new system for increasing prospective member conversion rates, which led to a 52% monthly increase. I have a 3 Star Silver Badge for Problem Solving on Hackerrank.

## Determination

I view my march through secondary school education, college and then a 4 year university degree as evidence of my determination to complete a goal. My achievements within Brazilian Jiu Jitsu were due to my commitment to constantly improve and learn on a daily basis. I will embrace the challenge my first software developer job will provide me and will look to further my knowledge of programming languages and techniques whilst not at work.

## Interpersonal Skills

Growing up in inner-city London I have always been exposed to a diverse range of people. Whilst at university this was only expanded. My interpersonal skills have been honed whilst working within the fitness industry as you are constaly meeting, befriending and working out with/alongside people from all over the world.
