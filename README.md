<p>I am a motivated and ambitious Full Stack Developer who enjoys solving complex problems and helping my team to succeed. I am naturally inquisitive and methodical in my thinking, always aiming to break down problems into small achievable actions. I also hold a MEng(Hons) in Civil Engineering from the University of Loughborough. I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to learn, whilst solving real-world problems with a team of ambitious people.</p>

## Skills

#### Fast Learner
- At Makers, we were continually pushed to grow and develop our skills on a daily basis. After spending most of the course learning Ruby, I was quickly able to pick up Javascript and start implementing it to build simple web apps. ~~For our final group project, we took this a step further and built our project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) resulting in a  marketplace connecting sellers and buyers.~~ Having not being taught any of these technologies during the course, it was a testament to how fast I can adapt and learn new technologies in a collaborative environment.

#### Problem Solving

The blending of maths and physics to solve practical real world problems was what initially convinced me that engineering was for me. For 4 years I was instructed on how to break down problems into small achievable actions, how to find multiple solutions and select the most appropriate. It was impressed upon me to benefits of having a holistic perspective to problem solving, to working to end-user requirements and the importance of taking account of all stakeholders wants and needs.  I find this approach to problem solving works best and I have seen the benefits to this approach in software development. I have a 3 Star Silver Badge for Problem Solving on Hackerrank.

#### Determination

My achievement of becoming a European Silver Medalist in the sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was down to my commitment to constantly apply myself to improve and learn on a daily basis. I will embrace the challenge of my first software developer job and will continually look to further my knowledge of programming languages.
