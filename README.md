**Who Am I**

I'm a problem solver - whether it be manipulating my opponent's body to perform involuntary yoga during a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu match, to figuring out the tensile strength of a steel-reinforced concrete beam - I've always understood the world around me to be one full of solvable 'opportunities'. I have therefore taken it upon myself to religously meet any and all challenges infront of me with 100% effort, as I relish the chance to find a solution, one 'opportunity' at a time.

I first really harnessed this predilection of mine whilst completing my Masters Degree in Civil Engineering degree at Lougborough University. Looking back at my studies it really *cemented* the fact that engineering was for me, but I no longer wished to keep it *civil*.  

During my studies I was exposed to the martial art/sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, where the goal is to submit your opponent by utilising a submission hold such as a joint lock or a strangulations. For me the allure of the sport was the constant recalculation of leverage maximisation and adaptive learning. I naturally interpreted the sport to be one where your opponent is contantly proiding problems for you which you have to immediately solve, and regardless of whether your solution was successful or not you could always learn from the experience.

Since my studies I have dedicated the last 7 years of my life to the martial art/sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I chose to work jobs that would allow me to train in a full-time capacity. I am very proud to have a European Silver medal to show for my efforts. I have also been afforded the opportunity to work as the Gym Manager at the gym where I trained, one of the biggest mixed martial arts gym in Europe which had over 1500 members. I regularly assisted in teaching the sport to beginners and have taught classes alone also. 

I now long for more mentally stimulating and challenging work. After completing free reosurces on Khan Acadmey and Codecademy I was sure coding was a fiield that would scratch my itch for problem solving while also giving me the satisfaction of building/creating something useful. I enrolled on the Makers Academy bootcamp to take the next step into the world of programming and am now looking to take another into the industry.


## Skills


#### Problem Solving

The blending of maths and physics to solve practical real world problems was what initially convinced me that engineering was for me. For 4 years I was instructed not ony in the specifics of combining bricks and mortar but also how to approach problems, how to find multiple unique solutions and then select from them the most appropriate. It was impressed upon me to benefits of having a holistic perpsective to problem solving, to working to end-user requirements and taking account of all stakeholders wants and needs. 

My training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has always presented me with a near instantaneous feedback loop as to whether my split second solution was successful or not. It has honed my practice of performance self-evaluation. Similarly, the daily managing of a gym that had up to 1500 members at one time has allowed me to seek out new and inventful solutions to constantly improve the gym's performance. My proudest achievement in this regard was creating and implementing a new system for increasing prospective member conversion rates, which led to a 52% monthly increase.

#### Determination

I view my march through secondary school education, college and then a 4 year university degree as evidence of my determination to complete a goal. Engineering degrees routinely require upwards of 30 hours of lectures and tutorials per week, which I always attended. On top of this I would apply myself outside of this time to develop my understanding of the subject matter at hand. Similarly my achievements within Brazilian Jiu Jitsu were only possible due to my commitment and the continual applicaion of myself to constantly improving and learning on a daily basis. I will embrace the challenge my first job will provide me and look to further my knowledge of programming languages and techniues while not at work.

#### Interpersonal Skills

Growing up in inner-city London I have always been exposed to a diverse range of people. While at university this was only expanded upon by meeting and studying with international students alongside people from different parts of the UK. Over the years working in the UK Fitness Industry has resulted in me meeting, getting to know and working out alongside hundreds of people.
