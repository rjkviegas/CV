**Who Am I**

I'm a problem solver - whether it be manipulating my opponent's body to perform involuntary yoga in a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu match to figuring out the tensile strength of a steel-reinforced concrete beam - I've always understood the world around me to be one full of solvable 'opportunities'. I have therefore taken it upon myself to religously meet any and all challenges infront of me with 100% effort as I relish the chance to find an apt solution, one 'opportunity' at a time.

I first really harnessed this predilection of mine whilst completing my Masters in Civil Engineering degree at Lougborough University. Looking back at my studies it really *cemented* the fact that engineering was for me, but I no longer wished to keep it *civil*.  

During my studies I was exposed to the martial art/sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, where the goal is to submit your opponent by utilising an ever evolving variety of joint locks or strangulations. At the higher levels the sport transcends any notion of brutish violence and is near solely based upon leverage, body mechanics and sheer determination. I naturally interpreted the sport to be one where your opponent is contantly proiding problems for you which you have to immediately solve, and regardless of whether your solution was successful it always offered you the opportunity to learn from it.

Since my studies I have dedicated the last 6 years of my life to the martial art/sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I have a European Silver medal to show for my efforts. I have also been afforded the opportunity to work as the Gym Manager at one of the biggest mixed martial arts gym in Europe. I regularly assisted in teaching the sport to beginners and have taught classes alone also. I am very proud of what I have achieved on and off of the mats but I now long for more mentally stimulating work, something that would scratch my itch for problem solving while also giving me the satisfaction of building/creating something useful.


## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Problem Solving

The blending of maths and physics to solve practical real world problems was what initially convinced me that engineering was for me. For 4 years I was instructed not ony in the specifics of combining bricks and mortar but also how to approach problems, how to find multiple unique solutions and then select from them the most appropriate. It was impressed upon me to benefits of having a holistic perpsective to problem solving, to working to end-user requirements and taking account of all stakeholders wants and needs.

My training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has always presented me with a near instantaneous feedback loop as to whether my split second solution was successful or not. It has honed my practice of performance self-evaluation. Similarly, the daily managing of a gym that had up to 1500 members at one time has allowed me to seek out new and inventful solutions to constantly improve the gym's performance. My proudest achievement in this regard was creating and implementing a new system for increasing prospective member conversion rates, which led to a 52% monthly increase.
